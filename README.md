# Fontaine-Fignos2014
Simple webpage to debug Arduino logic for a project at the annual gala of Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech in Bordeaux

The project was an abstract electronical "painting" aiming to reproduce a window with water drops. There were 50 LEDs. It was simpler and quicker to develop the algorithm on a webpage and then just translate the JS code to C code, because of the time needed each time to transfer the code to the Arduino chip, reset it and test it.
